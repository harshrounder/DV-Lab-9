Here you can see charts.csv shows the data of music and bestsellers_with_categories.csv shows the data for Books.
Now I have knitted the RMD file to get HTML , so you can click on final.html to see the visual dashboard on the
webBrowser.

final.rmd file is the Rmarkdown file in which I have used dashboard template and then done all the coding according to the template.
